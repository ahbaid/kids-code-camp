# Homework - Lesson 002

You've learned how to take input at the prompt using:
~~~~python
x=input("Enter a number: ")
~~~~
This assigns the value the user entered to the variable _x_.

Think about some mathematical formulae that you use and write a python program to take the needed inputs and calculate the result.
Here's an example of the area of a rectangle:

~~~~python
length=input("Enter the length of the rectangle: ")
width=input("Enter the width of the rectangle: ")
area = int(width) * int(length)
print ("Area of a rectangle is: ", area)
~~~~

Here are some examples to do for our next class:
1. Perimeter of a rectangle.
2. Area of a square.
3. Area of a triangle.
4. Area of a circle.
5. Perimeter of a circle.
6. Convert temperature from celsius to farenheit.
7. Convert temperature from farenheit to celsius.
8. Come up with one of your own!

You may collaborate, ask questions and help each other using our slack channel.

Please try first and then ask for help. Pay attention to details, typographical errors can 
cause your code to fail.

And lastly, have fun!

We'll begin lesson 003 with a review of lesson 002 and this homework.
